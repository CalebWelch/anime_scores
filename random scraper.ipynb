Without warning she exclaims \"Anpan!\" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Nagisa Furukawa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself.

Eventually he concedes and befriends her.  Tomoya learns Nagisa has been held back a year due to a severe illness and that her dream is to revive the school's drama club.  Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.\\n\\nAs Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems.

Out of retaliation and fear, humanity began focusing at an alternative source of energy: solar power. Different nations have united together to form three major factions\\u2014the Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations, the Advanced European Union, and the Human Reform League. Each of these sectors has access to a solar power generator, which gives them limitless energy.\\n \\nAs a result, countries that were once dependent on the sale of fossil fuels are now plunged in poverty, leading to years of warfare and internal strife over the control of solar energy.

However, Shungo's life ceases to be normal the moment a cute girl named Mayu Tsukimura descends into the middle of his school's campus in a military-grade helicopter. It turns out Ryoko sent this girl, along with her older brother Mikihiro, to live at the Ninomiya household.\\n\\nBut the newly-arrived siblings are a little special: Mayu is, in fact, a succubus and her brother, an incubus! And as if the circumstances are not problematic enough, Mayu is crippled with androphobia\\u2014the fear of men\\u2014and it's up to Shungo to help her overcome this at the behest of his sister. Ryoko plans to force Mayu to be closer to Shungo, and to do this, she\\u2019ll employ some questionable methods such as having them share the same bed and even take baths together. \\n\\nThe situation further complicates when student council president Reika Houjou arrives as the new maid of the Ninomiya family, and she will stop at nothing to thwart Shungo and Mayu\\u2019s sexually-geared training. With the sudden arrival of all these oddities, Shungo's ordinary life is about to be thrown into utter turmoil.\\n\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"FUNimation Entertainment,\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Oct 5, 2007              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        66,919\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        6.88\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"4,23,42,30\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><a class=\"icon-watch-pv fl-r\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2986/Bamboo_Blade/video\" title=\"Watch Promotional Video\">Watch Promotional Video</a><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2986/Bamboo_Blade\">Bamboo Blade</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA\" title=\"AIC A.S.T.A.\">AIC A.S.T.A.</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2986/Bamboo_Blade/episode\"><span>26 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"2986\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/4/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy\">Comedy</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/23/School\" title=\"School\">School</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/42/Seinen\" title=\"Seinen\">Seinen</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/30/Sports\" title=\"Sports\">Sports</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Bamboo Blade\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/13/6979.jpg?s=f3d80ceff50e944190d27dd9f48a6544\" srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/13/6979.jpg?s=f3d80ceff50e944190d27dd9f48a6544 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/13/6979.jpg?s=5febcf5b5b2d2f711921dd92bca7e1a1 2x\" width=\"167\"/>    <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2986/Bamboo_Blade\">Bamboo Blade</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Kojirou is the kendo instructor for Muroe High School and he's totally broke.

Due to Pluto's destruction, the asteroid, which is dubbed Thanatos, becomes temporarily stagnant. Now, in order to avoid Earth's impending destruction, the International Solarsystem Development Agency (ISDA) works on the \"D-Project\", and creates the \"Dragonaut\" after finding a dragon egg under the ocean. This weapon's primary purpose is to destroy the asteroid when the time comes. However, they soon find out that the asteroid is not their only threat, as powerful dragon-like creatures, which are bent on destruction, appear on Earth.\\n\\nAfter witnessing a murder by one of the creatures, Jin Kamishina, a lonely 18-year-old boy who lost his family in a shuttle accident two years ago, gets involved in the mysteries of the dragons and becomes the chosen pilot of the Dragonaut. Helping him on his journey is Toa, a mysterious girl who saves him from falling to his death after the creature attacks him. As they get deeper into the mysteries of the dragons, they encounter new friends and enemies, and also begin to develop a closer relationship. \\n\\n(Source: Wikipedia)</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"FUNimation Entertainment,\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Oct 4, 2007              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        48,367\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        6.79\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"4,23,37\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><a class=\"icon-watch fl-r\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3001/Moyashimon/video\" title=\"Watch Episode Video\">Watch Video</a><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3001/Moyashimon\">Moyashimon</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/235/Shirogumi\" title=\"Shirogumi\">Shirogumi</a>, <a href=\"/anime/producer/94/Telecom_Animation_Film\" title=\"Telecom Animation Film\">Telecom Animation Film</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3001/Moyashimon/episode\"><span>11 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"3001\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/4/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy\">Comedy</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/23/School\" title=\"School\">School</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/37/Supernatural\" title=\"Supernatural\">Supernatural</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Moyashimon\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/5/37533.jpg?s=a0f002dcc675cba94438f7373756586a\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/5/37533.jpg?s=a0f002dcc675cba94438f7373756586a 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/5/37533.jpg?s=25398390497af5b4bac8a9e929c20f91 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3001/Moyashimon\">Moyashimon</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Enter Tadayasu, a freshmen college student who can see and talk to cute, chibi bacteria and other microscopic organisms.

In fact, there seems to be no case that she can't solve, or any culprit that escapes justice. But within the walls of her detective agency lies the secret to her prolific crime-solving skills: the cases are actually solved by her assistant, Neuro Nougami.\\n\\nHowever, to call Neuro an ordinary man would be incorrect. In reality, he is a demon, who came to the human world in search of the ultimate mystery, having already solved every mystery in the demon world. With Yako as his proxy, he feasts on the negative energy released by humans when they commit crimes. Thus, he promises to help Yako solve the mystery of her father's death. But to do so, he must avoid drawing too much attention to himself, which is why Yako plays the role of the detective.\\n\\nMajin Tantei Nougami Neuro follows this unlikely duo as they solve case after case to satisfy Neuro's ravenous appetite and Yako's desperate search for the truth of her father's death.\\n\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Oct 3, 2007              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        45,402\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        7.74\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"7,37,10\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><a class=\"icon-watch-pv fl-r\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2369/Rental_Magica/video\" title=\"Watch Promotional Video\">Watch Promotional Video</a><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2369/Rental_Magica\">Rental Magica</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/218/Zexcs\" title=\"Zexcs\">Zexcs</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2369/Rental_Magica/episode\"><span>24 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Light novel</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"2369\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/7/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery\">Mystery</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/37/Supernatural\" title=\"Supernatural\">Supernatural</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/10/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy\">Fantasy</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Rental Magica\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/5/73999.jpg?s=c0ea1ea21c11ff85037ba27a68eda220\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/5/73999.jpg?s=c0ea1ea21c11ff85037ba27a68eda220 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/5/73999.jpg?s=5bd204f03f5af1593acc4965f8c03ecf 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2369/Rental_Magica\">Rental Magica</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Due to his father's disappearance, Itsuki Iba has to take over the family business: a magician dispatch service.

Together with their other friends, they form a team called the \"Bakugan Battle Brawlers\" in order to play this new game together. But unknown to these young friends, Bakugan is much more than a simple past time. Their game accidently sucks them into an alternate dimension called Vestroia, the home ground of Bakugan.\\n\\nVestroia has recently come under attack by creatures known as the Doom Beings. This realm is balanced by the Perfect Core, which itself is formed by the Infinity and Silent Cores. When the evil Bakugan Naga attempted to take this great power for himself, he was unable to absorb the negative energy he wished to steal and found himself trapped in the Silent Core.

Her obsession with food only causes her to be clueless about love.\\n\\nOne day, after saving a turtle that is stranded in a tree, Kirari meets with a handsome and gentle boy named Seiji, who gives her ticket to a SHIPS (a popular idol group) concert to show his gratitude for her saving his pet. Kirari then storms off to the concert and runs into another boy, who tears up her ticket and warns her to stay away from Seiji because she and Seiji live in different worlds. The outraged Kirari then sneaks into the concert, only to discover that Seiji and the boy who tore her ticket, named Hiroto, are actually members of SHIPS.\\n\\nFinally understanding the meaning of \"different worlds\" (Seiji is a popular idol while she is an average middle school student), Kirari refuses to give up.

Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \\n\\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \\n\\n(Source: AniDB) </span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Jun 15, 2007              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        11,411\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        7.55\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"8,13,25,36\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1695/Les_Mis\\xe9rables__Shoujo_Cosette\">Les Mis\\xe9rables: Shoujo Cosette</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation\" title=\"Nippon Animation\">Nippon Animation</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1695/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables__Shoujo_Cosette/episode\"><span>52 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Novel</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"1695\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/8/Drama\" title=\"Drama\">Drama</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/13/Historical\" title=\"Historical\">Historical</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/25/Shoujo\" title=\"Shoujo\">Shoujo</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life\" title=\"Slice of Life\">Slice of Life</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Les Mis\\xe9rables: Shoujo Cosette\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/1/1695.jpg?s=21dd24dbb09b02014606d758c9d9d040\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/1/1695.jpg?s=21dd24dbb09b02014606d758c9d9d040 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/1/1695.jpg?s=eb0412c5a4a41c1edbd1c738156c715a 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1695/Les_Mis\\xe9rables__Shoujo_Cosette\">Les Mis\\xe9rables: Shoujo Cosette</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Based on the famous classic novel Les Miserables.\\n\\nBeing a single mother is hard in early 19th Century France. When young Cosette was traveling with her mother trying to find a job and a place to live, they were always shunned away because very few employers hire single mothers. When she is promised with the prosperity of working in the big city, Cosette is separated from her mother in the hopes a caretaker will watch over her while her mother earns some money. Unfortunately this was a trick and the caretaker is a corrupt man who makes Cosette his indentured servant. Then the kind mayor of the town that Cosette makes her new home in sees how winds of change are so detrimental for children and families, and decides to do something about it.\\n\\n(Source: ANN)</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Jan 7, 2007              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        10,760\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        7.96\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"4,18,24\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10870/Ghost_in_the_Shell__Stand_Alone_Complex_-_Tachikoma_na_Hibi_TV\">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Tachikoma na Hibi (TV)</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/10/Production_IG\" title=\"Production I.G\">Production I.G</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10870/Ghost_in_the_Shell__Stand_Alone_Complex_-_Tachikoma_na_Hibi_TV/episode\"><span>12 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"10870\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/4/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy\">Comedy</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/18/Mecha\" title=\"Mecha\">Mecha</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi\">Sci-Fi</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Tachikoma na Hibi (TV)\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/4/30022.jpg?s=c929b0555b7d7496248111a473b29d70\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/4/30022.jpg?s=c929b0555b7d7496248111a473b29d70 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/4/30022.jpg?s=a9bee7594a04c839a6876ff1fe2f36b5 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10870/Ghost_in_the_Shell__Stand_Alone_Complex_-_Tachikoma_na_Hibi_TV\">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Tachikoma na Hibi (TV)</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Tachikoma TV series that aired on Animax.

She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \\n\\n(Source: AniDB)</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        1,940\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        6.32\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"4,14,10\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2165/Gegege_no_Kitarou_2007\">Gegege no Kitarou (2007)</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation\" title=\"Toei Animation\">Toei Animation</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2165/Gegege_no_Kitarou_2007/episode\"><span>100 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"2165\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/4/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy\">Comedy</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/14/Horror\" title=\"Horror\">Horror</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/10/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy\">Fantasy</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Gegege no Kitarou (2007)\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/6/27397.jpg?s=b28a8be8fc68761482ad9719f24ac327\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/6/27397.jpg?s=b28a8be8fc68761482ad9719f24ac327 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/6/27397.jpg?s=dae729e5f894924a682288d76181a8d8 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2165/Gegege_no_Kitarou_2007\">Gegege no Kitarou (2007)</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">The classic tale of Gegege no Kitaro told yet again.

One difference between this Kitaro and all of the others that came before him, is that this one has brown hair instead of the standard grayish silver. </span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Apr 1, 2007              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        1,822\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        7.02\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"4,36\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3006/Atashinchi\">Atashin'chi</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation\" title=\"Shin-Ei Animation\">Shin-Ei Animation</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3006/Atashinchi/episode\"><span>330 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F2007%2Ffall\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"3006\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/4/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy\">Comedy</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life\" title=\"Slice of Life\">Slice of Life</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Atashin'chi\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/8/50895.jpg?s=652baf3bb2dc4f461a9de11e4f622cae\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/8/50895.jpg?s=652baf3bb2dc4f461a9de11e4f622cae 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/8/50895.jpg?s=a3bdea9d0f47572ad312eaf1a7c91c0f 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3006/Atashinchi\">Atashin'chi</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Outrageous misadventures of an almost normal family with a housewife, her husband, and their two kids Yuusuke and Mikan.

He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.\\n\\nWith his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth\\u2014one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake.

The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.\\n\\nTheir bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.\\n\\nThe girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\\u2014Alwine's accomplice\\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert\\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was. The boy who never parted from his loyal, magical bow, endlessly engaged in dangerous and unthinkable missions.</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Jul 29, 1990              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        4,244\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        7.23\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"1,2,10,27\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2819/Dragon_Quest__Abel_Yuusha_Densetsu\">Dragon Quest: Abel Yuusha Densetsu</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\">-</span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2819/Dragon_Quest__Abel_Yuusha_Densetsu/episode\"><span>43 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Game</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F1991%2Fwinter\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"2819\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/1/Action\" title=\"Action\">Action</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/2/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure\">Adventure</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/10/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy\">Fantasy</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/27/Shounen\" title=\"Shounen\">Shounen</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Dragon Quest: Abel Yuusha Densetsu\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/12/21167.jpg?s=004bacade5616e0fb5f50f4680de137c\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/12/21167.jpg?s=004bacade5616e0fb5f50f4680de137c 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/12/21167.jpg?s=feaff82213165ecdb68e6baa0140f23b 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2819/Dragon_Quest__Abel_Yuusha_Densetsu\">Dragon Quest: Abel Yuusha Densetsu</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Dragon Quest is loosely based on Dragon Quest III.

She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \\n\\n(Source: AniDB)</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        1,940\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        6.32\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"40,37,8,42\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3077/Warau_Salesman\">Warau Salesman</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation\" title=\"Shin-Ei Animation\">Shin-Ei Animation</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3077/Warau_Salesman/episode\"><span>103 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F1991%2Fwinter\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"3077\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/40/Psychological\" title=\"Psychological\">Psychological</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/37/Supernatural\" title=\"Supernatural\">Supernatural</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/8/Drama\" title=\"Drama\">Drama</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/42/Seinen\" title=\"Seinen\">Seinen</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Warau Salesman\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/5/61389.jpg?s=b68324c56e91564e4406b149ef78d132\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/5/61389.jpg?s=b68324c56e91564e4406b149ef78d132 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/5/61389.jpg?s=72eda0bc0aa937ea504d3d0a21473ecc 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3077/Warau_Salesman\">Warau Salesman</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">Each episode follows Fukuzou Moguro, a traveling salesman, and his current customer.

class=\"preline\">An omnibus-format TV series consisting of anime adaptations of Japanese folk tales, this is one of Japan's longest-running TV series, and Group Tac's second TV series (the first was The Road to Munich, a documentary anime about the 1972 Olympics). The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \\n\\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \\n\\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \\n\\n(Source: Pelleas)</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Jan 7, 1976              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        466\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        6.44\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"2\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5249/Mitsume_ga_Tooru\">Mitsume ga Tooru</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\">          -</span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5249/Mitsume_ga_Tooru/episode\"><span>48 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">Manga</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F1991%2Fwinter\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"5249\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/2/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure\">Adventure</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Mitsume ga Tooru\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/13/10916.jpg?s=cc3a9b1ebaedb651af66e7297a93cca5\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/13/10916.jpg?s=cc3a9b1ebaedb651af66e7297a93cca5 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/13/10916.jpg?s=521804fa4addbd627facef8f6389fd9a 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5249/Mitsume_ga_Tooru\">Mitsume ga Tooru</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">He is a little boy who has a terrible power.

An impoverished boy, Tetsurou Hoshino, desires to purchase a pass on the Galaxy Express 999\\u2014a train that travels throughout the universe\\u2014because it is said that at the end of the line, those aboard can obtain a mechanical body for free.

She gives him a pass to the Galaxy Express under one condition: that they travel together.

She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \\n\\n(Source: AniDB)</span>\\n    <p class=\"licensors\" data-licensors=\"\"></p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"information\">\\n    <div class=\"info\">\\n      TV -\\n      <span class=\"remain-time\">\\n                  Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)              </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"scormem\">\\n      <span class=\"member fl-r\" title=\"Members\">\\n        1,940\\n      </span>\\n      <span class=\"score\" title=\"Score\">\\n        6.32\\n      </span>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>, <div class=\"seasonal-anime js-seasonal-anime\" data-genre=\"1,2,24,27\"><div>\\n    <div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title-text\">\\n        <a class=\"link-title\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6375/Kagaku_Ninja-tai_Gatchaman_F\">Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman F</a>\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"prodsrc\">\\n      <span class=\"producer\"><a href=\"/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production\" title=\"Tatsunoko Production\">Tatsunoko Production</a></span>\\n      <div class=\"eps\">\\n                <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6375/Kagaku_Ninja-tai_Gatchaman_F/episode\"><span>48 eps</span>\\n        </a>\\n      </div>\\n\\n      <span class=\"source\">-</span>\\n\\n      <a class=\"button_add btn-anime-watch-status js-anime-watch-status notinmylist\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/login.php?error=login_required&amp;from=%2Fanime%2Fseason%2F1980%2Fspring\" title=\"Quick add anime to my list\">add</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"genres js-genre\" id=\"6375\">\\n      <div class=\"genres-inner js-genre-inner\"><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/1/Action\" title=\"Action\">Action</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/2/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure\">Adventure</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi\">Sci-Fi</a>\\n      </span><span class=\"genre\">\\n        <a href=\"/anime/genre/27/Shounen\" title=\"Shounen\">Shounen</a>\\n      </span></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman F\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/2/45630.jpg?s=110c834b82e492f9d374a34310d525ec\" data-srcset=\"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/167x242/images/anime/2/45630.jpg?s=110c834b82e492f9d374a34310d525ec 1x, https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/334x484/images/anime/2/45630.jpg?s=a933d279404a911a10077dd527b85b7f 2x\" height=\"242\" width=\"167\"/>\\n        <a class=\"link-image\" href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6375/Kagaku_Ninja-tai_Gatchaman_F\">Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman F</a>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"synopsis js-synopsis\">\\n    <span class=\"preline\">After Leader X is seemingly destroyed for good at the end of Gatchaman II, a fragment of him that survived grows and mutates into Z.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \\n\\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \\n\\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio.
